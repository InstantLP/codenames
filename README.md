# Display Board for Codenames

This project is for playing Codenames on a large shared screen (eg. TV).
It will display a similar Codenames board (5x5) grid with exactly the same set of Codenames words.

The spymasters will need to use a real key card from the boardgame, or they can use the "Codenames Gadget" app,
which will display the key card on a mobile device.

Clicking on the words will toggle between the different colors (tan, grey, blue, red and black), denoting the different states.

Refreshing the browser will generate a new board, so be careful not to refresh while in the middle of gameplay.
